# Project-Triplicata
This is a Multimedia Senior Project. The projects consists of 6 illustrations of mythological creatures derived from the cultural background of 6 individuals I encounter on a daily basis. The illustrations can be found by scanning the QR codes on the surface of the 7-sided cube sculpture.
